IEA37 WFLO Case Studies 3 and 4
===============================

This repository holds the files necessary to participate in the second round of optimization case studies for IEA Task 37.

Please begin by reading [iea37-cs3-announcement.pdf](https://github.com/byuflowlab/iea37-wflo-casestudies/blob/master/cs3-4/iea37-cs3-announcement.pdf), included in this directory.

That document describes participation in the studies and intended use of the other files in this directory.

If you are thinking about perticipating, or have have begun a submission, you must contact me at Nicholas.F.Baker@Byu.edu so I am able to track an coordinate all participation.
